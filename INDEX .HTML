<p> My hobby is coding apps, websites etc in my free time. Whenever I feel bored I always do coding after my homework. I am 13 years old and read in 8th class. Now I knowver well that coding helps to increase our memory,problem solving skill and cognitive skills as well. Coding exercises can activate the brain's learning centres. This hobby can be devoloped but I got it naturally. Coding can keep on busy, concentrated and cheerful.
  Coding is a good source of enjoyable, concentration and computer technology. It make us aware of the future, helps us in future, knowledge but mt impotantluy succesfull</p>
